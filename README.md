# Resistor-Calculator_HTML

This project contains an HTML file that calculates the needed resistor for a given load, input voltage, and operating current. The page has a navy blue gradient background for a visually appealing look.

## Setup

1. **Download the HTML File**:
   - Save the provided [HTML code](resistor_calculator.html) to a file named `resistor_calculator.html`.

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Open the `resistor_calculator.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Input the Values**:
   - Enter the input voltage (V) in the first input field.
   - Enter the operating current (I) in the second input field.
   - Enter the load resistance (R<sub>L</sub>) in the third input field.

2. **Calculate the Resistor**:
   - Click the `Calculate Resistor` button to compute the needed resistor value.

3. **View the Result**:
   - The calculated resistor value will be displayed below the button.

## Example

1. Enter `12` in the "Input Voltage (V)" field.
2. Enter `0.5` in the "Operating Current (I)" field.
3. Enter `8` in the "Load (R<sub>L</sub>)" field.
4. Click `Calculate Resistor`.

The output will display:

Needed Resistor: 16.00 Î©
